  * Lessen the number of "useless" container elements
    * Pass `el` directly to view's to save on element count (reuse parent...)o
  * Use foundation validation goodies (included Abide lib)
  * Improve Grunt file and NPM Scripts handling
  * Make grunt a dependency so we don't have to install it globally
